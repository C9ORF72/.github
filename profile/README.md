This organization is for a small personal project dedicated to exploration of public omics data in Neuroscience space. This project will consist of several components:

1. A conceptual bioinformatics framework, the purpose of which is to help make bioinformatics analyses reproducible, reusable, composable, and shareable - without too much hustle. The framework is called The Framework.
   
3. A tool, called The Tool, to safely operate on the bioinformatics data within the constraints of The Framework.
   
5. A workspace for Neurosicence and neurology projects. This will be used for the main goal of the project - Explorations in Neuroscience.
